# MASTER_TASKS — MacVz Development Plan

Source of truth for the phased roadmap. Phases map to GitHub **Milestones**; tasks map to GitHub **Issues**. Regenerate with `/task-sync`.

> **Strategy:** MacVz is a *node-layer* project — a Virtual Kubelet provider that runs OCI workloads as native micro-VMs on Apple Silicon via `apple/container`. We do **not** build a control plane. See [README](../README.md).

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Title | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Scaffolding & Foundations | Buildable Go project: module, layout, CLI skeleton, CI, build tooling | ✅ Complete |
| P1 | Runtime Integration | Drive `apple/container` from Go on a single Mac: micro-VM lifecycle, logs/exec, density benchmark | ✅ Complete |
| P2 | Virtual Kubelet Provider MVP | Mac registers as a k8s virtual node and runs real Pods as micro-VMs | ✅ Complete |
| P3 | Cross-host Mesh Networking | WireGuard mesh + Pod IPAM so Pods across Macs communicate and Services resolve | ✅ Implemented |
| P4 | Hardening & Beta | Metrics, volumes, image arch/Rosetta, mTLS/RBAC, signing/notarization, multi-node e2e | ✅ Complete |
| P5 | Privileged Networking & Full Data Plane | Make cross-Mac Service traffic work end-to-end and remove manual sudo from day-to-day operation | ⬜ Planned |
| P6 | Kubernetes Workload Compatibility | Support common Deployment-era Kubernetes primitives needed by real applications | ⬜ Planned |
| P7 | Multi-node Operations | Make Mac node bootstrap, joining, diagnostics, and removal repeatable | ⬜ Planned |
| P8 | Real App Validation | Run useful public and project-specific Kubernetes applications on MacVz | ⬜ Planned |
| P9 | Production Hardening | Improve recovery, resource accounting, packaging, upgrades, and long-running reliability | ⬜ Planned |

## Milestone Acceptance Criteria

- **P0** — `go build ./...`, lint, and tests are green in CI.
- **P1** — Go boots an Alpine micro-VM in seconds; `logs`/`exec` work; per-host concurrent-VM ceiling and per-VM RAM overhead are measured and recorded.
- **P2** — `kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sleep 3600` lands a micro-VM on the Mac; `kubectl logs`/`exec` work; node shows in `kubectl get nodes`. Operator-facing run/verify/cleanup steps and expected output are documented in [docs/P2_SMOKE_TEST.md](P2_SMOKE_TEST.md); RBAC and manifests under [deployments/](../deployments/).
- **P3** — A Service backed by Pods on two different Macs is reachable through normal Kubernetes networking.
- **P4** — Multi-node e2e suite green; signed/notarized `macvz-kubelet` build; volumes + image-arch handling supported.
- **P5** — Two-Mac e2e passes with `mesh.enabled: true` and `podNetwork.enabled: true`; Pod-to-Pod and Service traffic cross the WireGuard data plane; operators no longer need to start the main kubelet process with manual sudo.
- **P6** — A multi-Deployment application using ConfigMaps, Secrets, ServiceAccounts, probes, and image pull credentials can roll out and recover through normal Kubernetes controllers.
- **P7** — A new Mac can join the MacVz node pool through a documented bootstrap flow; existing nodes can be drained, diagnosed, and removed without manual cleanup.
- **P8** — At least one public Kubernetes application and one CBB-compatible subset run on MacVz and expose a browser-visible service.
- **P9** — Long-running soak tests survive kubelet/helper restarts, orphan cleanup works, resource usage remains bounded, and release artifacts can be installed, upgraded, rolled back, and removed.

## Current Validation Snapshot

As of 2026-06-19, `main` has passed the two-node baseline described in
[MULTI_NODE_TEST_REPORT_2026-06-19.md](MULTI_NODE_TEST_REPORT_2026-06-19.md):

- two MacVz nodes register as Ready;
- Pods schedule to each Mac and clean up their micro-VMs;
- `logs`, `exec`, `port-forward`, metrics, and stats work through the kubelet API;
- Services publish EndpointSlices with one Ready endpoint per Mac;
- cross-node Service data-plane reachability remains blocked until the privileged
  WireGuard + `podNetwork` path is enabled and verified.
