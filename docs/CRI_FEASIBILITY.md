# CRI Feasibility Track

This track evaluates whether MacVz can move from a Virtual Kubelet provider to a
Kubernetes CRI runtime path backed by `apple/container`.

The current shipped architecture remains Virtual Kubelet. This document is a
feasibility plan and evidence log for a possible route change, not a commitment
to replace the provider path before the CRI risks are understood.

## Target Shape

The desired route-two architecture is:

```text
k3s / kubelet
  -> CRI RuntimeService + ImageService
    -> MacVz CRI adapter
      -> apple/container
        -> Linux micro-VM workload on Apple Silicon
```

If feasible, k3s or a regular kubelet would talk to MacVz through the standard
CRI socket instead of scheduling to a Virtual Kubelet node.

## Phase Plan

| Phase | Goal | Exit Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRI-P0 | Feasibility evidence | `apple/container` command surface and current MacVz runtime abstractions are mapped to CRI; hard blockers are named. |
| CRI-P1 | CRI skeleton | kubelet can connect to a MacVz CRI socket and receive sane `Status` responses. |
| CRI-P2 | Pod sandbox spike | `RunPodSandbox`, `StopPodSandbox`, `RemovePodSandbox`, and `PodSandboxStatus` work for a minimal sandbox model. |
| CRI-P3 | Single-container Pod | kubelet can create/start/stop/remove one container in one sandbox using a public arm64 image. |
| CRI-P4 | Image service | pull/list/status/remove image flows work, including registry auth and arm64/Rosetta policy. |
| CRI-P5 | CNI and Pod networking | kubelet-driven Pod networking has a repeatable lifecycle on macOS without manual route/pf steps. |
| CRI-P6 | Logs, exec, attach, port-forward, stats | common `kubectl` operations work through kubelet over CRI surfaces. |
| CRI-P7 | Volumes, projected data, probes | ConfigMaps, Secrets, ServiceAccounts, emptyDir, hostPath policy, and probes behave like regular kubelet workloads. |
| CRI-P8 | k3s compatibility hardening | A k3s node can run a compatibility suite and survive restart/cleanup/upgrade tests. |

## CRI-P0 Scope

CRI-P0 should answer four questions:

1. Can `apple/container` expose enough lifecycle primitives for kubelet CRI?
2. Can MacVz model Kubernetes Pod sandbox semantics on top of
   `apple/container` without lying to kubelet?
3. Can networking be integrated with kubelet/CNI lifecycle instead of the
   current Virtual Kubelet side path?
4. Are the unknowns small enough to justify CRI-P1/P2 implementation work?

## Current Evidence

Collected on 2026-06-21 from this development host:

```text
container CLI version 1.0.0 (build: release, commit: unspeci)
container system status: running
installRoot: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/container/1.0.0_1/
appRoot: /Users/chimera/Library/Application Support/com.apple.container/
```

The CLI exposes useful primitives:

- container lifecycle: `create`, `start`, `stop`, `delete`, `inspect`, `list`
- image lifecycle: `image pull`, `image inspect`, `image list`, `image delete`
- interactive surfaces: `logs`, `exec`
- resource accounting: `stats --format json --no-stream`
- filesystem ingress: `--volume`, `--mount`, `--tmpfs`
- process options: env, user/group, cwd, tty/stdin, ulimit
- network options: `--network`, `--dns`, `--dns-search`, `--publish`

These are enough for a CRI skeleton and a single-container Pod spike, but not
yet enough to declare the full route feasible.

## CRI Mapping

| CRI Area | `apple/container` Surface | Feasibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RuntimeService `Status` | `container system status` | Likely | Already used by the current runtime `Ready` check. |
| ImageService pull/status/list/remove | `container image pull/inspect/list/delete` | Likely | Registry auth is global runtime state today; concurrent authenticated pulls need serialization. |
| Create/start/stop/remove container | `container create/start/stop/delete` | Likely | Existing `pkg/runtime/container` already wraps these operations. |
| Container status | `container inspect`, `container list --all --format json` | Likely | Existing parser maps lifecycle states and guest IPs. |
| Logs | `container logs [-f] [-n]` | Likely | Already wired to `kubectl logs` through Virtual Kubelet. |
| Exec | `container exec [-i] [-t]` | Likely | Already wired; attach semantics still need separate validation. |
| Stats | `container stats --format json --no-stream` | Likely | Existing stats parser feeds metrics. |
| Volumes | `--volume`, `--mount`, `--tmpfs` | Partial | Projected data can be materialized on host and bind mounted; kubelet-managed mounts must be reconciled with macOS paths. |
| Pod sandbox | No native CRI sandbox object | High risk | Need a MacVz-owned sandbox model. One `apple/container` VM per Kubernetes container does not equal one Pod sandbox. |
| Multi-container Pod | Not represented by current MacVz model | High risk | The current provider rejects multi-container Pods. CRI kubelet expects multiple containers can share one Pod sandbox. |
| CNI lifecycle | No direct kubelet/CNI integration yet | High risk | Current data plane is MacVz-managed WireGuard/pf/route. CRI needs deterministic ADD/DEL timing around sandbox lifecycle. |
| Port-forward / attach | CLI surfaces exist only partially | Unknown | Need a kubelet-facing streaming server implementation and live behavior tests. |
| Checkpoint/restart recovery | Current adoption is provider-side | Unknown | CRI state store needs to survive adapter restarts and match kubelet expectations. |

## Phase 0 Decision

CRI-P0 is **conditionally positive**:

- Proceed to CRI-P1/P2 only as an isolated `develop` track.
- Do not replace the Virtual Kubelet architecture yet.
- Treat Pod sandbox, multi-container Pod semantics, and kubelet/CNI networking as
  the three make-or-break risks.

The next concrete milestone is a tiny CRI server that satisfies kubelet
connection and `Status`, followed by a sandbox spike that proves whether a
single-container Pod can be honestly represented without breaking kubelet
expectations.

## Reproducible Probe

Run:

```sh
make cri-feasibility
```

This performs a non-invasive CLI surface probe. It does not create, start, or
delete workloads unless explicitly requested:

```sh
MACVZ_CRI_LIVE=1 make cri-feasibility
```

The live mode is intentionally gated because it may pull images and boot a
micro-VM.
