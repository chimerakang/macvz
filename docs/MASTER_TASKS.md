# MASTER_TASKS — MacVz Development Plan

Source of truth for the phased roadmap. Phases map to GitHub **Milestones**; tasks map to GitHub **Issues**. Regenerate with `/task-sync`.

> **Strategy:** MacVz is a *node-layer* project — a Virtual Kubelet provider that runs OCI workloads as native micro-VMs on Apple Silicon via `apple/container`. We do **not** build a control plane. See [README](../README.md).

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Title | Goal | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Scaffolding & Foundations | Buildable Go project: module, layout, CLI skeleton, CI, build tooling | ✅ Complete |
| P1 | Runtime Integration | Drive `apple/container` from Go on a single Mac: micro-VM lifecycle, logs/exec, density benchmark | ✅ Complete |
| P2 | Virtual Kubelet Provider MVP | Mac registers as a k8s virtual node and runs real Pods as micro-VMs | ✅ Complete |
| P3 | Cross-host Mesh Networking | WireGuard mesh + Pod IPAM so Pods across Macs communicate and Services resolve | ✅ Implemented |
| P4 | Hardening & Beta | Metrics, volumes, image arch/Rosetta, mTLS/RBAC, signing/notarization, multi-node e2e | ✅ Complete |
| P5 | Privileged Networking & Full Data Plane | Make cross-Mac Service traffic work end-to-end and remove manual sudo from day-to-day operation | ⬜ Planned |
| P6 | Kubernetes Workload Compatibility | Support common Deployment-era Kubernetes primitives needed by real applications | ⬜ Planned |
| P7 | Multi-node Operations | Make Mac node bootstrap, joining, diagnostics, and removal repeatable | ⬜ Planned |
| P8 | Real App Validation | Run useful public and project-specific Kubernetes applications on MacVz | ⬜ Planned |
| P9 | Production Hardening | Improve recovery, resource accounting, packaging, upgrades, and long-running reliability | ⬜ Planned |

## Milestone Acceptance Criteria

- **P0** — `go build ./...`, lint, and tests are green in CI.
- **P1** — Go boots an Alpine micro-VM in seconds; `logs`/`exec` work; per-host concurrent-VM ceiling and per-VM RAM overhead are measured and recorded.
- **P2** — `kubectl run alpine --image=alpine --restart=Never -- sleep 3600` lands a micro-VM on the Mac; `kubectl logs`/`exec` work; node shows in `kubectl get nodes`. Operator-facing run/verify/cleanup steps and expected output are documented in [docs/P2_SMOKE_TEST.md](P2_SMOKE_TEST.md); RBAC and manifests under [deployments/](../deployments/).
- **P3** — A Service backed by Pods on two different Macs is reachable through normal Kubernetes networking.
- **P4** — Multi-node e2e suite green; signed/notarized `macvz-kubelet` build; volumes + image-arch handling supported.
- **P5** — Two-Mac e2e passes with `mesh.enabled: true` and `podNetwork.enabled: true`; Pod-to-Pod and Service traffic cross the WireGuard data plane; operators no longer need to start the main kubelet process with manual sudo.
- **P6** — A multi-Deployment application using ConfigMaps, Secrets, ServiceAccounts, probes, and image pull credentials can roll out and recover through normal Kubernetes controllers.
- **P7** — A new Mac can join the MacVz node pool through a documented bootstrap flow; existing nodes can be drained, diagnosed, and removed without manual cleanup.
- **P8** — At least one public Kubernetes application and one CBB-compatible subset run on MacVz and expose a browser-visible service.
- **P9** — Long-running soak tests survive kubelet/helper restarts, orphan cleanup works, resource usage remains bounded, and release artifacts can be installed, upgraded, rolled back, and removed.

## Current Validation Snapshot

As of 2026-06-19, `main` has passed the two-node baseline described in
[MULTI_NODE_TEST_REPORT_2026-06-19.md](MULTI_NODE_TEST_REPORT_2026-06-19.md):

- two MacVz nodes register as Ready;
- Pods schedule to each Mac and clean up their micro-VMs;
- `logs`, `exec`, `port-forward`, metrics, and stats work through the kubelet API;
- Services publish EndpointSlices with one Ready endpoint per Mac;
- cross-node Service data-plane reachability remains blocked until the privileged
  WireGuard + `podNetwork` path is enabled and verified.

| #45 | Support restartPolicy Always and controller-managed workload expectations | P6 | in progress — restart loop + docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #46 | Support ConfigMap-backed environment variables and volume mounts | P6 | in progress — env + volume projection, docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #47 | Support Secret-backed environment variables and volume mounts | P6 | in progress — `secretKeyRef`/`envFrom secretRef` env + read-only `secret` volume projection (items, modes, optional), values never logged; tests in `pkg/provider/secrets_test.go`, docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #48 | Support envFrom, valueFrom, fieldRef, and resourceFieldRef translation | P6 | in progress — unified env resolver covers `envFrom` precedence, literal `$(VAR)` expansion, `fieldRef` metadata/spec paths, and `resourceFieldRef` CPU/memory/ephemeral-storage divisors; tests in `pkg/provider/downward_test.go`, fixture coverage in [test/e2e/p6-compat](../test/e2e/p6-compat/) |
| #49 | Support imagePullSecrets and private registry authentication | P6 | in progress — dockerconfigjson pull secrets resolved per Pod, registry login/pull/logout in the driver, docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #50 | Implement readiness, liveness, and startup probe handling | P6 | in progress — exec/HTTP/TCP probes gate readiness, restart on liveness failure, startup gating; docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #51 | Improve ServiceAccount token projection and in-cluster API compatibility | P6 | in progress — projected kube-api-access volume (bound token via TokenRequest, cluster CA, namespace) materialized at the standard path, docs in [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #52 | Define supported and unsupported securityContext behavior for MacVz Pods | P6 | in progress — field-by-field policy: maps `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`/`readOnlyRootFilesystem`/`capabilities` onto runtime flags, accepts VM-isolation no-ops, rejects `privileged`/`seLinux`/`Localhost` seccomp+appArmor/`procMount`/`sysctls` terminally; tests in `pkg/provider/securitycontext_test.go` + `pkg/runtime/container/driver_test.go`, model in [README](../README.md) and [docs/WORKLOADS.md](WORKLOADS.md) |
| #53 | Build a multi-Deployment compatibility fixture for rollout validation | P6 | in progress — P6 acceptance workload under [test/e2e/p6-compat/](../test/e2e/p6-compat/) (web + checker Deployments, ConfigMap/Secret/probe/ServiceAccount/Downward coverage), `run.sh` validates rollout/status/logs/exec/Service with redacted diagnostics; `make compat` + CI `compat` job |
| #54 | Create a node bootstrap/join command or documented workflow | P7 | in progress — `macvz-kubelet bootstrap` renders a node config from the minimum join inputs (kubeconfig, node name, internal IP, pod CIDR, mesh address/peers) with optional WireGuard keypair + self-signed serving TLS; `macvz-kubelet doctor` preflights runtime, kubeconfig/API reachability, wireguard tooling, privileged helper, pf/forwarding, and serving-TLS validity, naming each missing prerequisite; workflow in [docs/NODE_JOIN.md](NODE_JOIN.md); tests in `pkg/bootstrap/` |
| #55 | Automate WireGuard key generation, public key exchange, and config rendering | P7 | in progress — `macvz-mesh` helper (`make mesh`): `keygen` (stable 0600 key), `export` (public-only node metadata, derives key/endpoint), `peer` (renders `mesh.peers:` YAML or wg `[Peer]` blocks that round-trip into config); rotation documented in [docs/NETWORKING.md](NETWORKING.md); tests in `pkg/config/metadata_test.go` + `pkg/network/wireguard/config_test.go` |
| #56 | Add node health and readiness diagnostics across runtime, provider, mesh, and pod network | P7 | in progress — `pkg/health` aggregates checks into a single report that distinguishes control-plane (registration + node-lease freshness), runtime (apple/container readiness), and data-plane (privileged helper, WireGuard mesh/routes, IP forwarding, pod attachments) failures, with text + JSON rendering and a ready/not-ready verdict that names the blocking class+check; served live from the kubelet at `/healthz/diagnostics` (200 ready / 503 not ready, `?format=json`) wired from the running components; complements join-time `macvz-kubelet doctor` (#54). Aggregation/checker tests in `pkg/health/`, wiring tests in `cmd/macvz-kubelet/diagnostics_test.go` |
| #57 | Add node drain and safe workload cleanup guidance/tooling | P7 | in progress — `kubectl drain` flow + expected controller rescheduling documented in [docs/NODE_DRAIN.md](NODE_DRAIN.md); per-Pod teardown already destroys VMs + detaches pod-network rules via `DeletePod`; new `macvz-kubelet cleanup` reaps orphan `macvz-*` micro-VMs (API-aware, `--dry-run`/`--all`) and flushes the pf anchor for post-drain/post-crash verification; `runtime.Lister`/`Driver.List` + exported `provider.WorkloadID`; tests in `pkg/drain/` |
| #58 | Add node removal workflow, including route, peer, pf, and VM cleanup | P7 | in progress — `macvz-kubelet remove` runs the departing node's permanent teardown in order, best-effort + idempotent: delete Node object → reap all MacVz micro-VMs (reuses #57 `pkg/drain`) → flush pf anchor → tear down WireGuard routes+interface (`wireguard.Mesh.Remove`); `--yes` safety gate, `--dry-run`/`--keep-node`, partial-failure reporting; remaining-node peer pruning stays a documented SIGHUP step. Orchestration in `pkg/noderemove` (+tests), wiring in `cmd/macvz-kubelet/remove.go` (+tests); runbook + recovery in [docs/NODE_REMOVAL.md](NODE_REMOVAL.md), ops section in [docs/MULTI_NODE_OPS.md](MULTI_NODE_OPS.md) |
| #59 | Produce a local diagnostic bundle command for support and bug reports | P7 | in progress — `macvz-kubelet bundle` collects config (loaded + raw), node object, recent events, live health report (#56), runtime status/containers/images, helper status, routes, IP forwarding, WireGuard interface, and pf anchor rules into a timestamped directory + tar.gz; every source is best-effort (a failing source records the error instead of aborting). All output passes through `pkg/diagbundle`'s redactor — PEM private keys, WireGuard private/preshared keys, JWT/bearer tokens, and the values of a curated sensitive-key set are stripped, while public material (certs, public keys, CA data) is kept for debugging. Redaction is the security chokepoint (Builder-level, so new sources cannot leak); tests in `pkg/diagbundle/` (redaction + packaging), docs in [docs/DIAGNOSTIC_BUNDLE.md](DIAGNOSTIC_BUNDLE.md) |
| #60 | Document multi-node operations, failure modes, and recovery playbooks | P7 | in progress — operator lifecycle runbook in [docs/MULTI_NODE_OPS.md](MULTI_NODE_OPS.md) covers join, verify, drain, remove, upgrade, network troubleshooting, and cleanup with commands + expected output; it is the order-of-operations index that ties together [NODE_JOIN.md](NODE_JOIN.md) (#54), the `macvz-mesh` peer workflow (#55), and the live `/healthz/diagnostics` report (#56), and routes each failure class to the per-symptom recovery procedures in [PRIVILEGED_NETWORKING.md](PRIVILEGED_NETWORKING.md). Drain (#57), automated removal (#58), and a diagnostic-bundle command (#59) are documented as the manual procedures operators run today, flagging where future tooling will replace a step. README + README.zh-TW link the runbook. Validation: two-Mac walkthrough (join→drain→remove with peer-list pruning). |
